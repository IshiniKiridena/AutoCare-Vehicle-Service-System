# AutoCare-Vehicle-Service-System

The “AutoCare” is a web application based on vehicle service and vehicle parts selling companies. This online platform provides customers with a variety of options to get their required services done in the easiest way possible. The customers can simply register into the system by providing personal details as well as register their vehicle so that the company can track the customer and their vehicles concurrently. An account for each customer will be managed and their details can be updated and deleted as well. Upon registering to the system, a form will be available for the customer to enter the details after selecting their desired service. After that, they can make a booking to get that service done from the company. Since this system is particularly designed for a company, the manager has more privilege over the functions happening in the system. For instance, the parts for the vehicles bought from the suppliers can be added to the system and even the stocks can be tracked by the manager. The details of the quantities of these vehicle parts can be further updated or deleted from the system. Moreover, the bills can be handled by entering the amount charged for services and sold parts to the customers at the company. The service charges, prices for vehicle services, and parts can be added to the system. A monthly report can be generated from this to observe the profit gained from the company by doing vehicle services and part selling. On the First hand, This system will give the customer the best experience on getting their vehicle serviced without staying in queues for long hours and on the other hand, the company owner/manager can get rid of the disadvantages from the manual way of booking, billing and stock handling in contrast to this automated system which provide reliable means to manage their daily tasks effortlessly and accurately.
